Bash Notes

~ Home directory
pwd - print working directory
cd - change directory
ehco - print to screen
echo "Hello World" > greetings.txt ===== push to file
cat  - display contents of text file
less - look at larger files

use echo to chain outputs together

ps - look at processes
ps -ef === look at all processes

use "|" to pipe programs together. Can send output directly to less
ps -ef | less   ===== Neat

mkdir - create new directory

cd  ==== will auto nav back to home

tab to autocomplete

use "which" command to see if something is installed
