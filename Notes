Bash Notes

~ Home directory
pwd - print working directory
cd - change directory
ehco - print to screen
echo "Hello World" > greetings.txt ===== push to file
cat  - display contents of text file
less - look at larger files

use echo to chain outputs together

ps - look at processes
ps -ef === look at all processes

use "|" to pipe programs together. Can send output directly to less
ps -ef | less   ===== Neat

mkdir - create new directory

cd  ==== will auto nav back to home

tab to autocomplete

use "which" command to see if something is installed

curl -O https://bphogan.com/thatconf.zip
^^ downloads file
-O saves it as same file name

ctrl + a  to jump to start of line
ctrl + e  to jump to end of line
^cat^less wil run last command with replaced value

history -- will show all the commands you've ran so far
!! run previous command again
sudo !! will run previous command as sudo

!<cmdNumber>  will run the number command

cd ..  ==== up one directory

usr/bin will be programs installed by package manager
usr/local is where you can store programs --- not managed by operating system
var/ is where website and logs should be kept
opt/ optional directory - not used often
tmp/ temporary directory

ls -l contains permissions for files -- very useful
rw-r--r--   --first 3 are for person who owns the file which is listed after
            --second 3 is permission applied to the group
            --third 3 is everyone else on the machine
            -- THIS IS IMPORTANT

ls -al shows all entries. This is nice so you can see the parent directories
 .. ---parent directory
 .  ---current directory

ls -alh will give sizes in Kilabytes,mgb,and gb

ls -alhd /var/log only shows directory information

cd - === will take you back to previous directory
cd /bin === this from root of filesystem
cd bin/ === relative to location
cd ../lesson_4 === you can go up and nav in one command

pushd /usr/bin ==== will take you to that directory
               ==== pushes locations to the array

popd  ==== takes you to last directoroy in the array 

dirs  ==== print out directory stack
dirs -v == shows numbered array

use ~ to specify home directory

pushd +2 === navigate to the number directory
git config --global user.name "menneric84"

touch === create file -- will also update timestamp 
    --- useful for prompting events

single > will overrite file
double >> will concat

date >> hello.txt
will add date stamp

cat > names.txt
will create new file that you can add to
ctrl + d will terminate proccess

cat << EOF

cat << EOF > names.txt
    === useful for creating files

cat is supposed to be used to concat files
cat hello.txt names.txt > newfile.txt
    --create a new file which is the concat of both files
head -n 2 /var/log/syslog
    - show first 2 lines of file
tail -n 10 show last 10 lines of file
    --- tail -n 3
    --- tail -n 3 names.txt | head -n 1 

mkdir -p files/docs/diagrams files/docs/markdown
