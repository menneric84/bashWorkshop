Create this file and folder structure in your home folder using as few commands as possible:

      website/
      ├── about/
      ├── images/
      ├── products/
      └── stylesheets/
          └── style.css

Copy this folder structure to `/opt/website`.
      
Change the permissions on `/opt/website` and all its files so that your user has full permissions.
      
Create a new file in the `/opt/website` directory  called `index.html` file that contains the following contents:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <title>My web page</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>My web page</h1>
      </body>
    </html>

Copy the new `index.html` page to the `about` and `products` folders.

Rename the `products` folder to `products_and_services`.
